# üèõÔ∏è About me
I'm currently an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education of The [Central China Normal University (CCNU)](https://www.ccnu.edu.cn/). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Bang Wang](https://eic.hust.edu.cn/teacher/wangbang/index.htm). After that, I have spent times as a Postdoctoral Researcher at HUST, supervised by [Prof. Xiang Bai](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/baixiang/zh_CN/more/1412472/jsjjgd/index.htm). My research interests cover the broad area of large-scale language model, natural language processing, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems, with a current focus on information extraction, public opinion events and intelligence analysis. I have published nearly 30 papers in the top international AI conferences and journals such as ACL, COLING, EMNLP, CSUR, Neu.Net., ESWA, etc. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YrcnOxYAAAAJ"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FJason-Xiang5231%2FJason-Xiang5231.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>

<span style="color: red;">Prospective students:</span> I am looking for master's students interested in scientific research to work together, as well as self-motivated undergraduate students to study in the research group. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email with your resume.
